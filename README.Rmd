# CurVol

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of CurVol is to document useful functions to analyze the
volatility of functional time series data. Methods and tools in this package replicate hypothesis testing, model estimation, and backtesting
in a series of papers:

ARCH model. Econometric Theory, 29(2), 267-288.

## Installation

You can install the released version of CurVol from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("CurVol")
```

## R topics documented

1. backtest.var - backtest the intra-day VaR forecasts
2. basis.est - estimate non-negative basis functions.
3. basis.score - functional scores by projecting the squared process onto     given basis functions.
4. dgp.fgarch - generate functional data following the functional
    ARCH(1) or GARCH(1,1) process.
5. dgp.fiid - generate iid functional data following Ornsteinâ€“Uhlenbeck       process.

    cumulative intra-day return (CIDR), overnight cumulative intra-day
    return (OCIDR).
13. sample\_data - a sample data containing S\&P 500 intra-day price.
14. var.forecast - forecast daily/intra-day Value-at-Risk.
