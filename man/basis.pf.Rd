\usage{
basis.pf(yd, M, a, h)

basis.pf(yd, M, a, h)
}
\arguments{
\item{yd}{A (grid_point) x (number of observations) matrix drawn from N discrete evaluation curves.}

\item{M}{The number/order of basis functions, by default \eqn{M = 10}.}

\item{a}{The regularization parameter with recommended values of 0.73 - 0.75.}

\item{h}{The forecasting horizon.}
}
\value{
List of objects:

basis: a (grid_point) x (M) matrix containing discrete evaluations of M non-negative predictive factors.

tve: the total variations explained by each non-negative predictive factor.

\description{
basis.pf function extracts non-negative predictive factors from the squared process of conditionally heteroscedastic curves, presumably, so that they may be modelled with a Functional GARCH model subsequently.
